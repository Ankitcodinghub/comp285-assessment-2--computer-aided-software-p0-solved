See end of document

This is the second of two assessments for COMP285 where each contributes 50% of the final module mark.

The general purpose is assessment of the following learning outcomes:

1. Perform software development tasks using the techniques of Automated Testing, Continuous Integration and Test Driven Programming

2. Use Ant, JUnit and Eclipse both individually and jointly as tools for Automated Testing, Continuous Integration and Test Driven Programming with the main stress on JUnit testing and test driven programming with Eclipse.

The goal of this assignment is working on an initial (partial) implementation of a game ‚ÄúHangman‚Äù in the style of Test Driven Programming in Java by using Unit Testing with JUnit4 in the framework of Eclipse. Two compatible Java files are given to you: a source file Hangman.java and JUnit4 test case HangmanTest.java, both implemented partially and Hangman.java also containing some bugs.

You will need to finish/correct this implementation and testing framework. All tests should succeed and the game should be functioning well. The game ‚ÄúHangman‚Äù is described as follows:

The computer chooses a word (the ‚Äúword-to-be-guessed‚Äù), and displays a star sign * for each letter in the word (the *-form of the word).

The user inputshttps://.com a letter: if that letter occurs in the word, then every occurrence of that letter in the word is shown (i.e., the letter is written instead of the *).

If the letter does not occur in the word or is chosen repeatedly, the user loses a life. Play continues in this way until either Add

‚Äì all the letters in the answer have been input and the user has won, or ‚Äì the user has lost all their lives (10) and the computer has won.

After each round, the user has the option of quitting or playing another round. If quitting, the number of rounds played is shown and the round numbers are displayed which the user has won.

You can download the (correctly implemented compiled version of) Java class MyHangman.class into a directory H:dir and play it by running from the command line as follows:

H:dir&gt;java MyHangman

It has a slightly different name. You will work with Hangman.java, HangmanTest.java and their compiled classes.

Presentation of work

In Eclipse, create a new project with the project name (directory) of the form the student‚Äôs

surname_name_ID

Similarly, at the beginning of the two .java files given you should present your personal data, plus personal e-mail address where the feedback will sent.

For simplicity, when creating this project in Eclipse, choose the option ‚ÄúUse project folder as root for source and class files‚Äù. The source files and compiled files will be under the same project directory named as described above. Also

for simplicity, this time no package declaration should be used in .java files (although Eclipse discourages this choice).

All the actions (such as creating the project, Java source file, JUnit test case, https://.com etc.) should be done by Eclipse wizards.

After creating Hangman.java, it should be populated by the code above.

Add

After finishing the these steps, the JUnit 4 test case HangmanTest.java should be created similarly by using an appropriate the Test Case wizard of Eclipse. While using this wizard appropriate setUp and tearDown methods should be chosen, then after clicking NEXT and checking all (11) methods of the source file HangmanTest.java, except the main method, 11 stub test methods will be generated automatically. The wizard will also suggest adding JUnit 4 library to the build path. You should include this otherwise it will be impossible to run JUnit test case from Eclipse. After the stub class HangmanTest.java is generated, it should be populated by the code given above, again with your personal data.

Two MSWord files Hangman.doc and HangmanTest.doc containing the codes of Hangman.java and HangmanTest.java should be created (directly from the

The main feature of this program (a game) is user input from the console. The problem is how to test it. To this end, imitation of the sequence of input strings by the user is done by a Vector &lt;String&gt; INPUT and a mock method

input_next() imitating the standard one input.next() using

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

This should be clearly understood before doing anything. See examples of how it works in the current versions of both files Hangman.java and HangmanTest.java.

The general advice is to work first on something simple. Then there will be fewer problems since you can then depend on what you have already resolved and well-tested.

You should comment appropriately all the code you add to the sample code. This way you can demonstrate your understanding of what they do. This will also be taken into account when marking the work.

All Java files presented by students should be compilable and appropriately formatted.

To submit this work, the following should be done: Go to your physical workspace by using Windows Explorer.

Right-click your project name surname_name_ID, choose send to Compressed (zipped) folder (with the same name). The resulting zip file surname_name_ID.zip will automatically contain your project directory and all it contents.
